			<h1>CSY1019 Software Engineering 1</h1>

<p>For the construction of any software system to be successful, appropriate knowledge (and the correct utilisation) of an assortment of techniques and tools is required throughout the traditional software life cycle. Requirements engineering, systems specification, analysis, design, and effective code development are all essential activities in any substantive software development. Implicitly, the appropriate knowledge and correct understanding of the processes involved in each of these developmental life-cycle activities are therefore essential for any software system developer.</p>

<p>This module concentrates on creating object-based solutions to Software Engineering problems within several contemporary integrated development environments.  </p>
