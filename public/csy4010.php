<p>The final year computing project double module provides the opportunity for the student to undertake the research and self-management of a Computing related problem that permits the integration of the main areas of study in the studentâ€™s study programme. The module also permits the development of higher order intellectual skills, a professional approach and appropriate personal qualities that are required for independent working in a research or development environment. It is considered important that the project should not merely be a direct application of existing knowledge but that it should also encompass, at least in part, the need to acquire and apply development techniques hitherto unknown to the student.</p>

<p>An essential outcome for this module is that the student project deliverable includes the design and development of a system, a software application or a novel functional approach that relates to the main areas of student study, and that can be used, applied or demonstrated in some way. Students enrolled on the BSc Business Computing may engage on a research centred project resulting in a report of analysis of an appropriate topic. </p>';
